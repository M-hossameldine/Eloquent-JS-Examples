# Callbacks
/*************************************************/
# An asynchronous programming approch:
  - is to make functions that perform a slow action take an extra argument, a "callback" function.
  - The action is started, and when it finishes, the callback function is called with the result.

# Ex: setTimeout() : 
  waits a given number of milliseconds and then calls a function.

  Syntax: setTimeout(CB_function, waitingTime)

  setTimeout(() => console.log("Callback log"), 500);

# Crow nest Computers have:
  * "Long-term data storage bulb": 
  - (JSON file) where pieces of information are stored so that they can be retrieved later
  - Storing or finding data, takes a moment, so the interface to long-term storage is asynchronous and uses callback functions.

  * "Storage bulbs" store pieces of JSON-encodable data under names. A crow might store information about the places where it's hidden food under the name "food caches",
    - Which could hold an array of names that point at other pieces of data, describing the actual cache.

  # => To look up a food cache in the storage bulbs of the big Oak nest, a crow could run code like this:
  
  import {bigOak} from "./crow-tech";
  
  bigOak.readStorage("food caches", caches => { 
    let firstCashe = cashes[0];
    bigOak.readStorage(firstCahse, infor => {
      console.log(info);
    });
  });
